# Issues Found in PDD.EDD.md Review

## 1. Lack of Automated Tests for Miner (nockchain) Client
- **Description:**
  - There are no automated or integration tests for the miner client in pool mode (gRPC client mode). The `nockchain` crate does not contain a `tests` directory or any test files covering the gRPC mining workflow.
- **Impact:**
  - The core mining workflow (receiving work, submitting results, error handling) is not automatically verified, which may lead to undetected regressions or protocol incompatibilities.
- **Recommendation:**
  - Add integration tests for the miner in pool mode, covering:
    - gRPC connection to the pool-server
    - Receiving and processing work orders
    - Submitting valid and invalid work results
    - Handling server disconnects and reconnections
    - Error and edge case handling

## 2. Pool-Server Integration Tests Use TCP Simulation Instead of Real gRPC
- **Description:**
  - The existing integration tests for `nockchain-pool-server` (in `tests/stability_test.rs`) use raw TCP connections to simulate miners, rather than real gRPC clients. The `test_full_workflow` is only a placeholder and not implemented.
- **Impact:**
  - These tests do not fully verify the actual gRPC protocol or the end-to-end workflow between real miner clients and the pool-server.
- **Recommendation:**
  - Implement real gRPC-based integration tests for the pool-server, including:
    - Multiple miners connecting via gRPC
    - Receiving work orders via the gRPC stream
    - Submitting work results and verifying server responses
    - Simulating disconnects, reconnects, and error scenarios

## 3. General Recommendations
- Mark all new integration tests with appropriate tags (e.g., `#[ignore]` if they require a running server) and document how to run them.
- Ensure that all core workflows described in PDD.EDD.md are covered by automated tests to prevent regressions and ensure protocol compatibility.

---

**Summary:**
- The core architecture and protocol implementation match the PDD.EDD.md specification. However, automated test coverage is incomplete, especially for the miner client and for true gRPC end-to-end scenarios. Addressing these issues will significantly improve reliability and maintainability.
